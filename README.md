My proposal is to investigate whether or not a major league baseball player’s statistics improve, stay the same, or decrease after receiving a large contract.  It would be interesting to compare data from before and after receiving a large contract to see if having the security of a lot of money results in a player being complacent, or does an athlete continue to work hard in order to excel?  I will be analyzing 10 position players by comparing statistics before the contract was signed to after the contract was signed. The data I use will include at bats, hits, doubles, triples, homeruns, runs batted in, walks, strike outs, batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, and games played.  I will be using https://www.baseball-reference.com/ to gather statistics. The website https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/contracts/ will be used to gather information concerning the dollar amount of the contract, years of the contract, as well as the age of each player.
I will be using https://williamkoehrsen.medium.com/data-analysis-with-python-19434f5d6324 as a reference for my algorithm. For example, I will create several tables to compare the players’ average performance over 3 years prior to the contract, compared to their performances the contract year, plus an additional 2 years. The results of the data will be analyzed to see if the value of the contract is warranted if performance is above or below a specific threshold.
Results will be evaluated by comparing the most common used statistics in baseball which are batting average, RBI’s, home runs, slugging percentage, and on base percentage.  Data will be displayed on a graph to visualize the data for each athlete.  Another graph will show at bats, hits, double, triples, walks and strike outs.  In addition, the athlete’s statistics will be displayed on a graph to see the variance in how much athletes earned compared to how they performed.

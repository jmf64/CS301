**Abstract**

This paper uses Major League Baseball (MLB) statistics and MLB payroll information to analyze the link between signing a contract and a player&#39;s performance. The data used are statistics from10 players before and after a new contract was signed as well as individual and team payroll.  The average of a player&#39;s statistics for the 3 years prior to signing the contract was compared to the contract year, plus an additional 2 years. The contract information included the age of the player and the yearly salary. Additional information used was the percent of a players&#39; salary compared to their team&#39;s payroll. The results were that these players&#39; salaries ranged from 11.9% to 47.9% of the total payroll of their team. The data showed no causality that signing a new contract impacts performance. Some players performance decreased after signing a new contract and some players performance increased.

**Introduction**

This paper analyzes whether or not a MLB player&#39;s performance changed after a new contract was signed.  This is an important topic because if there is a pattern that a player&#39;s performance declines after signing a large contract, owners may be hesitant to give players lucrative contracts.  Although every player is different, if it can be consistently shown there is a decline in performance after signing a contract, one can surmise that it is possible this occurs because players may not work as hard.  Since baseball is a team sport, there are some statistics that are dependent upon teammates. An example is if there are runners on base when a home run is hit, the player would earn more runs batted in. The percent of the player&#39;s salary compared to their team payroll was analyzed to determine how much money was spent on teammates. The metrics used were from the statistics of 10 position players who signed their contracts in their 20&#39;s.  The results of this paper show that 4 player&#39;s performance improved, and 6 player&#39;s performance decreased. Not only did the data not show causality between signing a contract and performance, there was no causality with the percent of a player&#39;s salary compared to their team payroll.

**Related Work**

There have been a variety of studies relating MLB team performance and the salaries of the players.  One study was titled &quot;Testing Causality Between Team Performance and Payroll&quot; (Hall, Szymanski, and Zimbalist, 2022).  One of the diagrams used for analysis included a scatter diagram of information from all clubs where a linear regression line showed only a small correlation of spending compared to winning percentages.  They concluded that baseball teams are less likely to be able to buy success because of trades, roster sizes and salary caps.  Another study analyzed the correlation between an MLB player&#39;s performance and salary (Koehrsen, 2017).  Koehrsen also used a scatter diagram to show the linear relationship between salary and performance, but only used hits, home runs and RBIs to determine a player&#39;s performance level.  William Smallwood did a study to determine if a player&#39;s performance changes after signing a MLB contract.  He studied 4,100 players from 2001-2015.  He used home runs, RBI&#39;s, strike outs, batting average and on base percentage for the statistics in his analysis. His study concluded players performance declined after signing a contract. He acknowledged that his study would have been more thorough if he looked at data from 2-3 years after signing the contract.

This study, has some similarities to the studies above, but also some differences.  When looking at the contract of a player, this study compared the yearly contract of a player in comparison to his team&#39;s total payroll.  Team payroll can be a significant factor in how a player performs because of the money that is available to pay teammates.  This study also used more statistics when doing the analysis, as well as an equal number of years before and after signing the contract.

**Data**

The data used in this study was from 10 position players by comparing statistics before the contract was signed to statistics after signing the contract. The data used included games played (GP), hits (H), doubles (2B), triples (3B), home runs (HR), runs batted in (RBI), walks (BB), strike outs (SO), batting average (BA), on base percentage (OBP), and slugging percentage (SLG).  A player&#39;s OBP is calculated by determining (Hits + BB + Hit by Pitch)/ At Bats + BB + Hit by Pitch + Sacrifice Flies). Slugging Percentage is based on dividing the total number of bases by the number of at bats. It is calculated by determining Hits + (2 X 2b) + (3 X 3B) + (4 X HR)/at bats.  The statistics used were from [https://www.baseball-reference.com/](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) .  There were 6 years of statistics used for each player.  There were 5 players whose data was used during 2020, which was a shortened season because of COVID-19.  The data for that year was prorated because the total number of possible games played in 2020 was only 60 games instead of 162.  The pre contract statistics were compared to the post contract statistics. The statistics for 3 years were added and divided by 3 for each category to determine an average. Three years before the contract was signed was the pre contract period and the first year of the contract, plus an additional 2 years, was the post contract period.  These years are labeled as 1, 2 and 3 to represent the years signed before the contract and 4, 5, and 6 to represent after the contract was signed. The website [https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/contracts/](https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/contracts/) was used to gather information concerning the dollar amount of the contract, as well as the age of each player when the contract was signed.  All contracts were signed between age 24-28.  The player&#39;s annual salary after signing the contract was compared to the total payroll of their team to determine what percent of the payroll the player received.  Team payroll information was gathered from [https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/payroll/](https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/payroll/) and [http://www.thebaseballcube.com/topics/payrolls/](http://www.thebaseballcube.com/topics/payrolls/).

**Methods**

My data sets were analyzed by using bar graphs to compare how each player performed during a 6-year time period.  The key statistics that are generally used in MLB contract negotiations are batting average, HR, RBI&#39;s.  In addition to using these statistics, the number of games played, at bats, walks, strikeouts, hits, doubles, triples, on base percentage, and slugging percentage were also used to analyze the performance of a player.  For example, if a player does not play in as many games as prior years, an assumption can be made that he had an injury.  When players experience an injury, they may have difficulty performing at an elite level.  Therefore, statistics may be skewed in that year.  Another example of needing to analyze additional statistics then what is considered to be key statistics is if a player&#39;s home runs decrease, but their batting average and other types of hits increased.  This means he had more base hits, but the ball did not leave the ballpark.  This approach of gathering more statistics for database sets gives a better, well-rounded analysis of a player&#39;s performance.  Another important area of this study is how much the player&#39;s salary was in comparison to the total payroll of their team because the higher the percent of the payroll one player receives; the less money can be spent on additional players.  The skill level of teammates, and how those teammates perform, impact the statistics of a player.

**Experiments**

The dependent variable used in this study were the statistics of each player.  The same statistical categories were used to analyze each player&#39;s performance.  The independent variables were the value of the contracts and the team payrolls.  Players signed their contract at different ages, the value per year of the contract varied, and the team payroll for each player was different.  The analysis of the data was used by using python to display bar graphs for each statistic. The graphs below show the changes during a 6-year period with the key statistics that are generally used to determine the value of a player. These statistics include RBI&#39;s, HR&#39;s and BA for each player.  Each bar represents a year. The first 3 bars are the years prior to signing the contract and the last 3 bars are the year the player signed the contract, plus 2 additional years.  The average pre contract and post contract statistics are displayed by adding the values for a category and dividing by 3. Then the percent of change after signing the contract is calculated.

The length restriction on this paper inhibits displaying all of the statistical analysis on each player. In an addendum to this report, there are bar graphs on games played, at bats, hits, doubles, triples, walks, strike outs, on base percentage, and slugging percentage. In order to do a thorough analysis of a player&#39;s performance, it is important to review all statistical categories.  The results of these experiments are also displayed with bar graphs and show the percent of change after signing their contracts. This was done by averaging the 3 years prior to signing the contract, and comparing it to the contract year, plus an additional 2 years for each statistic. The final analysis to determine if a player&#39;s performance increased or decreased was calculated by adding each percent change for each category (GP, hits, 2B, 3B, HR, RBI, BB, SO, BA, OBP, and SLG) and dividing by 11.

Bryce Harper showed an increase in these key metrics of 3.3% to 17.2% after signing his contract.

Joey Votto had an injury the year after he signed his contract.  He only played in 62 games.  This may be a factor with why his home runs fell 4.5%, RBIs 14.3%, and batting average 6%.

**Conclusions**

The results of this paper are that there is no causality between signing a new contract and a player&#39;s performance. Only 4 of the 10 players improved their performance after signing a large contract. Posey showed a 21.6% increase, Freeman 20%, Harper 15.1% and Machado 7.1%. Posey&#39;s yearly contract was 14%, 12.9%, and 11.9% of his team total team payroll. Harper&#39;s salary was 16%, 34.8% and 13.9% of his team payroll after signing his contract. Freeman&#39;s salary was 15.2%, 18.8%, and 19.9% of his team. Machado&#39;s salary was 28.8%, 41%, and 16.8% of his team payroll. There were 6 player&#39;s whose performance decreased. Altuve&#39;s performance decreased 23% after signing his contract, even though his payroll was only 14.6%, 13.8%, and 28.3% of his team payroll. Arenado&#39;s performance fell 16.7%. His salary was 20.7%, 47.9%, and 19.2% of his team. Hosmer decreased by 15.4%, Votto decreased 12.9%, Stanton 4.1% and Heyward 4%. Their percent of their team payroll ranged from only 12.5% to a high of 35.5%. These statistics show that although teammate&#39;s play a role in how players perform, Manny Machado and Bryce Harper had one year where their salary was 41% and 34.8% of their team, but they still continued to perform at an elite level. Altuve had a high of earning 28.3% and Arenado 47.9% of their team payroll, and their performance was below how they played prior to signing their contracts.

This study shows that how a player performs after signing a contract depends on the individual player. Six out of the 10 players in this study had decreased production. Although teammates can impact some statistics, if the percent of an individual&#39;s salary in relationship to team payroll is high, it does not necessarily mean the player who signed a large contract will show a decrease in performance.

A suggestion of a future study would be a deeper analysis of the statistics of the players in this study compared to the statistics of their teammates. The quality of teammates can impact individual statistics, so it would be interesting to see if the 6 players who showed a decrease in performance played with many teammates who also performed poorly.
